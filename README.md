# Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

This project was inspired by [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Using all of the information provided in the dataset, I wanted to know if I could build a regression model to predict the price of houses in Ames, Iowa. This project was also my first time participating in a kaggle competition.
